# Nearby-Restaurants-Search-Implementation
- Designed and implemented a search algorithm to find points within a given Chebyshev distance from a reference point
- It was acheived using 2D Range Tree, to efficiently store and retrieve (x,y) coordinates in an optmised ordered manner
- Implemented data structure in O(nlogn) & for a given query, returns all restaurants in a given range in  O(m + (log(n))^2)
